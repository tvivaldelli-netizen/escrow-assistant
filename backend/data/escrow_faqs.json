    "category": "Shortage",
    "question": "What is a shortage, and why might I have one?",
    "answer": "Your escrow account exists to pay escrowed items like property taxes and homeowners insurance on your behalf. A shortage occurs when your escrow account doesn't have enough funds to cover these payments. This can happen if your property taxes increased, your insurance premium went up, or there was an unexpected expense. After each annual escrow analysis, we calculate whether your account has enough to cover upcoming bills plus a required cushion, and if not, you'll see a shortage.",

    "category": "Shortage",
    "question": "How do I pay my shortage in full?",
    "answer": "You can pay your shortage in full by sending a one-time payment to Freedom Mortgage. You can pay online through your account at FreedomMortgage.com, by phone, or by mail. When making the payment, be sure to note it is for 'escrow shortage' so it is applied correctly. Paying in full will prevent your monthly payment from increasing to cover the shortage over time.",

    "id": "faq_3",
    "category": "Shortage",
    "question": "Can I spread my shortage payment over time?",
    "answer": "Yes, if you don't pay the shortage in full, Freedom Mortgage will automatically spread the shortage amount over 12 months and add it to your monthly mortgage payment. Your new payment amount will be shown on your escrow analysis statement. This way, you pay a little extra each month instead of one large sum.",

    "category": "Surplus",
    "question": "What is an escrow surplus?",
    "answer": "An escrow surplus occurs when your escrow account has more money than needed to cover your upcoming property taxes, insurance, and the required cushion. This can happen if your taxes or insurance decreased, or if you made additional escrow payments. When you have a surplus over $50, Freedom Mortgage will refund the excess amount to you.",

    "question": "When will I receive my surplus refund check?",
    "answer": "If your escrow surplus is greater than $50, we will mail you a refund check within 30 days of completing your annual escrow analysis. The check will be sent to the mailing address on file for your account. If you haven't received your check within 30 days, please contact Customer Care to verify your address and check status.",

    "question": "My insurance changed. What happens to my escrow?",
    "answer": "When your homeowners insurance premium changes, it affects your escrow account. If your premium increased, you may have a shortage and your monthly payment could go up. If it decreased, you may receive a surplus refund. We receive updates from your insurance company and adjust your escrow accordingly. The change will be reflected in your next escrow analysis.",

    "answer": "If you paid your insurance premium directly but we also paid it from your escrow account, please contact Customer Care with proof of your payment. We'll work with your insurance company to get the duplicate payment refunded, either to you or back to your escrow account. To avoid this, let us know before your premium is due if you plan to pay directly.",

  {
    "id": "faq_8",
    "category": "Taxes",
    "question": "My property taxes went up. How does this affect my payment?",
    "answer": "When property taxes increase, your escrow account needs to collect more money to pay them. This typically causes your monthly mortgage payment to increase. After we pay your higher tax bill or receive notice of the increase, we'll conduct an escrow analysis and send you a new payment amount. You may also have a shortage if the increase wasn't anticipated.",

    "answer": "If you've received a property tax exemption (such as a homestead, senior, veteran, or disability exemption), please send us documentation from your county tax assessor's office. You can upload it through your online account or mail it to us. Once verified, we'll update your escrow account and adjust your monthly payment accordingly, which may result in a lower payment or a surplus refund.",

    "question": "When will my PMI be removed?",
    "answer": "Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is typically removed when your loan balance reaches 78% of the original value of your home (based on the original purchase price or appraised value). You can also request cancellation when you reach 80% loan-to-value. To request early removal, you'll need to be current on payments, have a good payment history, and may need a new appraisal to confirm your home's value hasn't declined.",

    "question": "How do I request PMI removal?",
    "answer": "To request PMI removal, you can submit a written request through your online account or by mail. Your loan must be current, you should have a good payment history with no 30-day late payments in the last 12 months, and your loan balance must be at or below 80% of the original property value. We may require an appraisal at your expense to verify current property value.",

    "category": "Payment Changes",
    "question": "Why did my monthly payment change?",
    "answer": "Your monthly mortgage payment can change for several reasons: property tax increases or decreases, homeowners insurance premium changes, changes to your PMI, or the result of an annual escrow analysis showing a shortage or surplus. Your principal and interest portion typically stays the same (unless you have an adjustable-rate mortgage), but the escrow portion can change annually based on your tax and insurance bills.",

    "answer": "After an escrow analysis, your new payment amount typically takes effect 30 days from the date of your escrow analysis statement. The statement will clearly show your new payment amount and the effective date. This gives you time to adjust your budget or pay any shortage in full if you prefer to keep your payment lower.",

    "question": "What is an escrow analysis?",
    "answer": "An escrow analysis is an annual review of your escrow account to ensure we're collecting enough money to pay your property taxes and insurance when they're due. We look at what was paid out over the past year, project what will be owed in the coming year, and make sure there's a cushion (usually two months of payments) for unexpected increases. The result may show a shortage, surplus, or no change needed.",
