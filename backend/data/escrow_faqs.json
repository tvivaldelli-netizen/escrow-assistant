    "question": "What is a shortage, and why might I have one?",
    "answer": "Your escrow account exists to pay escrowed items like property taxes and homeowners insurance on your behalf. A shortage occurs when your escrow account doesn't have enough funds to cover these payments. This can happen if your property taxes increased, your insurance premium went up, or there was an unexpected expense. After each annual escrow analysis, we calculate whether your account has enough to cover upcoming bills plus a required cushion, and if not, you'll see a shortage.",

    "question": "How do I pay my shortage in full as a lump sum?",
    "answer": "You can pay your shortage in full by sending a one-time lump sum payment. You can pay online through your account, by phone, or by mail. When making the payment, be sure to note it is for 'escrow shortage' so it is applied correctly. Paying in full will prevent your monthly payment from increasing to cover the shortage over time. Note: Even if you pay the shortage in full, your monthly escrow payment may still increase if your taxes or insurance went up.",

    "category": "Shortage",
    "question": "Can I spread my shortage payment over monthly installments instead of paying in full?",
    "answer": "Yes, if you don't pay the shortage in full, we will automatically spread the shortage amount over 12 months and add it to your monthly mortgage payment. Your new payment amount will be shown on your escrow analysis statement. This way, you pay a little extra each month instead of one large sum. You can also pay a partial amount now and spread the remaining balance over 12 months.",

    "question": "What is an escrow surplus?",
    "answer": "An escrow surplus occurs when your escrow account has more money than needed to cover your upcoming property taxes, insurance, and the required cushion. This can happen if your taxes or insurance decreased, or if you made additional escrow payments. When you have a surplus over $50, we will refund the excess amount to you.",

    "answer": "If your escrow surplus is greater than $50, we will mail you a refund check within 30 days of completing your annual escrow analysis. The check will be sent to the mailing address on file for your account. If you haven't received your check within 30 days, please contact Customer Care to verify your address and check status.",

    "question": "My homeowners insurance changed or I switched carriers. What happens to my escrow?",
    "answer": "When your homeowners insurance premium changes or you switch carriers, it affects your escrow account. If your premium increased, you may have a shortage and your monthly payment could go up. If it decreased, you may receive a surplus refund. Please provide us with your new insurance policy details (company name, policy number, effective date) by uploading through your online account or contacting Customer Care. The change will be reflected in your next escrow analysis.",

We'll work with your insurance company to get the duplicate payment refunded. If you received a refund check from your insurance company, you can apply it to your escrow by mailing a check with your loan number noted 'Apply to Escrow' or by contacting Customer Care to make a payment over the phone.",

    "category": "Taxes",
    "question": "My property taxes went up. How does this affect my payment?",
    "answer": "When property taxes increase, your escrow account needs to collect more money to pay them. This typically causes your monthly mortgage payment to increase. After we pay your higher tax bill or receive notice of the increase, we'll conduct an escrow analysis and send you a new payment amount. You may also have a shortage if the increase wasn't anticipated.",

You can upload it through your online account or mail it to us. Once verified, we'll update your escrow account and adjust your monthly payment accordingly, which may result in a lower payment or a surplus refund.",

    "question": "When will my PMI be automatically removed?",
    "answer": "Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is automatically cancelled when your loan balance reaches 78% of the original home value (based on the original purchase price or appraised value at closing), based on your scheduled payments. This is required by the Homeowners Protection Act. You don't need to take any action - it will be removed automatically when you reach this threshold through normal payments.",

    "answer": "You can request PMI cancellation early when your loan balance reaches 80% of the original property value (before the automatic 78% threshold). To request early removal: 1) Submit a written request through your online account or by mail, 2) Your loan must be current with no 30-day late payments in the last 12 months, 3) You may need an appraisal at your expense to verify current property value. Contact Customer Care to start the process.",

    "category": "Payment Changes",
    "question": "Why did my monthly payment change?",
    "answer": "Your monthly mortgage payment can change for several reasons: property tax increases or decreases, homeowners insurance premium changes, changes to your PMI, or the result of an annual escrow analysis showing a shortage or surplus. Your principal and interest portion typically stays the same (unless you have an adjustable-rate mortgage), but the escrow portion can change annually based on your tax and insurance bills.",

    "answer": "After an escrow analysis, your new payment amount typically takes effect 30 days from the date of your escrow analysis statement. The statement will clearly show your new payment amount and the effective date. This gives you time to adjust your budget or pay any shortage in full if you prefer to keep your payment lower.",

    "question": "What is an escrow analysis and what does it calculate?",
    "answer": "An escrow analysis is an annual review of your escrow account to ensure we're collecting enough money to pay your property taxes and insurance when they're due. We look at what was paid out over the past year, project what will be owed in the coming year, and make sure there's a cushion (usually two months of payments) for unexpected increases. The result determines if you have a shortage (not enough), surplus (too much), or no change needed. Your payment breakdown shows how much goes to taxes, insurance, and any other escrowed items.",

    "answer": "Your escrow analysis is conducted once a year, typically around the anniversary of your loan closing or a few months before your property taxes are due. You'll receive an escrow analysis statement in the mail and/or online. If your taxes or insurance have changed significantly, you may request an off-cycle analysis by contacting Customer Care, though this is not guaranteed.",

    "answer": "Yes! If you are enrolled in automatic payments directly with your mortgage servicer (not through your bank's bill pay), your payment amount will be updated automatically when your escrow analysis results in a new payment amount. You don't need to take any action - we'll withdraw the new amount on your next scheduled payment date after the change takes effect. You'll receive notice of the new amount before it's withdrawn.",

    "answer": "Yes, if you pay through your bank's bill pay service (not your servicer's auto-pay), you must manually update your payment amount when it changes. After receiving your escrow analysis statement with your new payment amount, log into your bank's bill pay and update the amount before the effective date.

However, we recommend focusing on bringing your loan current first before addressing the shortage separately. The shortage may be included in any repayment plan or loan modification.

    "answer": "While you can make additional payments to your escrow account, this generally won't prevent future payment changes. Your monthly escrow payment is recalculated annually based on projected expenses - if your taxes or insurance increase, your payment will still need to increase to cover those higher costs. Additional escrow payments may reduce or eliminate a current shortage, but the escrow portion of your monthly payment is calculated annually per federal regulations regardless of your current balance.",
