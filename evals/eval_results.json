Other Escrow Items: In some cases, your escrow account may include funds for other items like flood insurance, HOA fees, or other related expenses.\n\nBy collecting a portion of these expenses each month, your escrow account ensures that there are enough funds available to pay these bills when they come due. If there are any changes in these expenses, such as an increase in insurance premiums or property taxes, your escrow payment may be adjusted accordingly during your annual escrow analysis.",

Mortgage Insurance (if applicable): If you have Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) or Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP), this may also be included in your escrow payment.\n\n4. Other Escrow Items: Your escrow payment may also include amounts for other items such as homeowners association (HOA) fees, if applicable.\n\nIt's important to note that your monthly escrow payment may fluctuate if there are changes in your property taxes, insurance premiums, or other escrow items.

    "answer": "If you have changed your insurance and want to remove your PMI, you can take the following steps:\n\n1. **Insurance Change**: Ensure that you have updated your new insurance information with your mortgage servicer. This includes providing them with a copy of your new insurance policy.\n\n2. **PMI Removal Request**: To request the removal of PMI, make sure you meet the criteria mentioned earlier: your loan must be current, you should have a good payment history with no 30-day late payments in the last 12 months, and your loan balance must be at or below 80% of the original property value. You may need to provide an appraisal at your expense to verify the current property value.\n\n3. **Communication**: It's essential to keep your mortgage servicer informed of these changes and your intention to remove PMI. You can submit a written request through your online account or by mail.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need assistance with the process, feel free to reach out to Customer Care at 1-800-220-3000 for further guidance.",

      "Payment Changes (faq_12)",

    ],
    "answer": "Yes, if your property taxes went up and your insurance premium went down, your monthly mortgage payment could still change. When property taxes increase, your escrow account may need to collect more money to cover the higher tax bill, resulting in a higher monthly payment. Conversely, if your insurance premium decreased, you may receive a surplus refund, which could potentially lower your monthly payment. It's important to wait for an escrow analysis to be conducted by Freedom Mortgage to determine the exact impact on your payment.",
